# MACJ Model Integration in ContentFlow

ContentFlow explicitly integrates the Madman, Architect, Carpenter, and Judge (MACJ) model of writing:

- **Madman (Ideation):** Encourages free-flowing, uninhibited idea generation.
- **Architect (Blueprint):** Focuses on planning, structure, and strategy.
- **Carpenter (Crafting):** Diligently builds content according to the blueprint.
- **Judge (Refinement):** Critically evaluates, edits, and improves content.

This integration ensures a balance of creativity, structure, execution, and quality control throughout the content lifecycle.
