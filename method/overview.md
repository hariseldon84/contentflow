# ContentFlow Method Overview

ContentFlow divides content creation into six iterative phases, each mapped to creative and execution archetypes (MACJ):

1. **Ideation (Madman):** Generate creative ideas and explore possibilities.
2. **Blueprint (Architect):** Strategically structure and plan content.
3. **Crafting (Carpenter):** Create and assemble content assets.
4. **Refinement (Judge):** Critically evaluate and polish content.
5. **Distribution (Disseminator):** Deliver content to the target audience.
6. **Analysis (Auditor):** Measure performance and inform future cycles.

Each phase includes best practices, templates, and activities to guide teams from concept to impactful delivery.
