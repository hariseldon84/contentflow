- Identify what worked well and what could be improved
- Document learnings and insights

## Best Practices
- Use analytics tools for data collection
- Conduct regular review meetings
- Share findings with the whole team
- Apply insights to future content cycles

## MACJ Integration
This phase requires an analytical and objective approach, aligning with the principles of evaluation and learning, though not directly mapping to a specific MACJ archetype.
